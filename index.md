## Selected Dataset  

**Name:** clothing-dataset  

**URL:** [https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/clothing-dataset/tree/master](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/clothing-dataset/tree/master)  

**Applications:**

The clothing dataset includes labeled categories (clothing type and whether it belongs to kids). It can be used for training AI models for clothing classification, and it helps with the automatic recognition of clothing types from images. In addition, it is useful when applied in research as a benchmark for fine-grained image classification task models. Moreover, it can be applied in recommendation systems by suggesting clothes in the same category, It is useful in some online shopping platforms.

## Selected Book  

**Title:** *The Promise and Peril of Big Data*

**Author:** David Bollier

**Institute:** the Schumacher Center for a New Economics 

**URL:** [ https://www.aspeninstitute.org/publications/promise-peril-big-data/]( https://www.aspeninstitute.org/publications/promise-peril-big-data/)  

**Introduction:**

The Promise and Perils of Big Data is very interesting, it discusses the opportunities and risks brought by data-driven technologies, emphasizing the dual role of big data as both a powerful tool for advancing science and society and a potential source of risk. In this  book, it stresses some key issues, such as the problem of bias in big data interpretation and the value of visualization in discovery. I am very interested in it because these topics are closely related to my research, which focuses on understanding the relationship between human dynamics and the environment using big data.

The book stresses that big data is not inherently objective; its interpretation inevitably involves selecting and processing variables. “Data cleaning” (deciding which features to retain or discard) introduces subjectivity, while merging different data sources can amplify biases. In my work, when processing geospatial or socioeconomic environment datasets that might influence human dynamics, the choice of factors to include, such as sidewalks, greenery, and demographic composition, will directly impact research outcomes. Therefore, maintaining transparency in data preparation and acknowledging and reflecting on potential biases within studies is essential.

In addition, the book emphasizes that visualization serves as a powerful tool for revealing hidden information within big data. It not only displays social dynamics that are difficult to perceive directly in raw data but also helps researchers explore the model space more broadly, combining statistical analysis with visual insights. In my research, I can  visualize the human dynamics,for example, the distribution of homelessness, on a map to understand their spatial distribution Also, I can make a plot of the Pearson correlation coefficients  between human dynamics and environmental factors, allowing for a more rapid understanding of the extent to which different factors influence human dynamics, thereby enhancing the interpretability of research findings.
