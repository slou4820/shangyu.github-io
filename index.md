## Selected Dataset  

**Name:** clothing-dataset  

**URL:** [https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/clothing-dataset/tree/master](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/clothing-dataset/tree/master)  

**Applications:**

The clothing dataset includes labeled categories (clothing type and whether it belongs to kids). It can be used for training AI models for clothing classification, and it helps with the automatic recognition of clothing types from images. In addition, it is useful when applied in research as a benchmark for fine-grained image classification task models. Moreover, it can be applied in recommendation systems by suggesting clothes in the same category, It is useful in some online shopping platforms.

## Selected Book  

**Title:** *The Promise and Peril of Big Data*

**Author:** David Bollier

**Institute:** the Schumacher Center for a New Economics 

**URL:** [ https://www.aspeninstitute.org/publications/promise-peril-big-data/]( https://www.aspeninstitute.org/publications/promise-peril-big-data/)  

**Introduction:**

The Promise and Peril of Big Data examines both the opportunities and risks of data-driven technologies. It discusses how correlations should be interpreted, the value of visualization for discovery, and the ethical challenges of privacy and fairness, highlighting the dual role of Big Data as a powerful tool and a potential source of social risk.

I am interested in this book because it closely relates to my research. Its focus on correlation versus causation connects to my work on urban perception and running amount forecasting, where I evaluate whether spatial patterns reflect real causal links. The emphasis on visualization resonates with my use of geospatial mapping to reveal hidden urban dynamics, and the discussion of ethics aligns with my need to handle sensitive geospatial data responsibly.
