## Selected Dataset  

**Name:** clothing-dataset  

**URL:** [https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/clothing-dataset/tree/master](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/clothing-dataset/tree/master)  

**Applications:**

The cloth dataset includes labeled categories such as clothing type and whether the item belongs to kids or adults. It can be used to train AI models for clothing classification, enabling automatic recognition of clothing types from images, distinguishing between kids’ and adults’ categories, and helping organize large product catalogs on e-commerce platforms. In addition, the dataset supports recommendation systems by suggesting clothing within the same category, such as similar kids’ T-shirts, or by recommending complementary items based on type and age group. Finally, it provides value for computer vision benchmarking, as it can be applied in research on fine-grained image classification, domain adaptation between kids and adults, and multi-label classification tasks.

## Selected Book  

**Title:** *The Promise and Peril of Big Data*

**Author:** David Bollier

**Institute:** the Schumacher Center for a New Economics 

**URL:** [ https://www.aspeninstitute.org/publications/promise-peril-big-data/]( https://www.aspeninstitute.org/publications/promise-peril-big-data/)  

**Introduction:**

The Promise and Peril of Big Data examines both the opportunities and risks of data-driven technologies. It discusses how correlations should be interpreted, the value of visualization for discovery, and the ethical challenges of privacy and fairness, highlighting the dual role of Big Data as a powerful tool and a potential source of social risk.

I am interested in this book because it closely relates to my research. Its focus on correlation versus causation connects to my work on urban perception and running amount forecasting, where I evaluate whether spatial patterns reflect real causal links. The emphasis on visualization resonates with my use of geospatial mapping to reveal hidden urban dynamics, and the discussion of ethics aligns with my need to handle sensitive geospatial data responsibly.
